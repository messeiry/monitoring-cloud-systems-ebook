# Monitoring Cloud Systems Guide

## Background and Strategic Fit üéØ

Monitoring plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth operation and performance of IT systems, networks, and cloud environments. Understanding what monitoring entails and how it aligns with business objectives is essential for organizations to effectively leverage monitoring solutions. Let's delve into the background and strategic fit of monitoring in the context of IT operations.

### What is Monitoring?

Monitoring, derived from the Latin word "monit" meaning "warned," involves observing and checking the progress or quality of something while keeping it under systematic review. In the IT & Network operations industry, monitoring encompasses observing IT systems, cloud environments, and application code to ensure optimal performance and quality. Each monitoring domain has its own set of measurements and characteristics, defining what to monitor, how to monitor, and setting expectations for the results of those measurements.

In summary, monitoring IT systems can be defined as:

"Observing operational system behaviors, workflow, and processes over time to assure quality and enhance end services."

### Importance of Assurance

While monitoring solutions often include extensive reporting capabilities, reporting alone is just one aspect of the monitoring process. It provides a view of the data collected from various sources, facilitating navigation through operational data. However, the true value lies in assurance, which can be achieved through various means. This book explores different methods and strategies to attain assurance through monitoring solutions, ensuring that they effectively support and sustain business objectives.

If a monitoring solution fails to contribute to sustaining the business, it has not achieved its intended goal. Thus, the focus should not solely be on reporting metrics but on leveraging monitoring to provide assurance and enhance overall business performance.
